## About this Repo

I started "dotfiling" with a single .bashrc file. 

As my needs of customizing my development environment grew, so did my configurations.

I have gone through many iterations of this repository, this is the current version.

[Here is a cool post on the philosophy behind robust dotfiles](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/) from [@holman](https://github.com/holman)

## Using my Configurations

As with any configurations, don't blindly copy these onto your system.

If you want to try my configurations:
1. Fork this repository
2. Review all the code
3. Remove what doesn't make sense to you or you don't want
4. Make the necessary changes for these configurations to work with your system

### How to use my configs

*I hope to integrate some sort of automation for installation in the future. Alas, I am lazy*

#### 1. Clean up existing dotfiles
- If you have existing dotfiles, back them up and archive them
- If you have a pretty robust set of dotfiles already, I would recommend browsing through this repository and selecting the things you want to try and injecting them into your existing configs 
<br/>(*do so at your own risk. always make sure you understand the consequences of making a change to a configuration*)

#### 2. Fork and clone this repository
- [Fork the repository](https://github.com/terminalPoltergeist/dotfiles/fork)
- Clone the repository
    - `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME-HERE>/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles`

#### 3. Make changes
- Many of these configurations will not work "out of the box".
    - I have redacted sensitive personal information that you will need to provide for the configurations to work
